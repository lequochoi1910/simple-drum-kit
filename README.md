📚 What I Learned

As a Software Engineering student (Java-focused), this project helped strengthen my frontend foundations:

✔ DOM Events

Using addEventListener("click") and addEventListener("keydown")

Passing event keys to functions for dynamic control

✔ Audio Manipulation

Playing sounds instantly with new Audio().play()

Mapping different keys to different audio files

✔ JS + CSS Integration

Adding/removing CSS classes (classList.add, classList.remove)

Creating a quick animation effect using setTimeout()

Made with ❤️ in VietNam.
